    Colors.xml contains all of the colors that are used in the application.  In this case,
    there are only four text colors that are defined in this file.  These colors are used on
    each of the RadioButtons to display the color of actual fruit.

    Please note: Be careful where you place XML comments. They are
    best situated outside of each XML element.
